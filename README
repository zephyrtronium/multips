Multips is a binary patch applier designed to apply multiple patches at once. It explains any conflicts found between patches and refuses to apply patches that conflict. Its intended use is collaboration, but it is by no means thus limited.

Currently, multips is a command-line tool supporting reading of IPS patches and reading/merging to its custom ZP format. The future of multips holds diffing files and eventually a GUI.

For invocation help, try multips -help.
